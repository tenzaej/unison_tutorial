# unison_tutorial
repo made as part of the Unison tutorial

Inspired by [this article about Unison and distributed programming](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/09/26/unison_programming_language/), I am working through [this tutorial](https://www.unisonweb.org/docs/tour).

Probably not going to get terribly far - more background with Haskell would help, probably - but I am determined to tinker nonetheless.

I wonder how difficult it would be to write a minimalist spacemacs layer / emacs mode for unison? You have your 'scratch' buffer and the UCM buffer, but then there might be more things, like a "project directory" which lists the structure, and allows one to move into it in the usual neotree ways, etc.
