# unison_tutorial
repo made as part of the Unison tutorial

Inspired by [this article about Unison and distributed programming](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/09/26/unison_programming_language/), I am working through [this tutorial](https://www.unisonweb.org/docs/tour).

Probably not going to get terribly far - more background with Haskell would help, probably - but I am determined to tinker nonetheless.
